# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to produce an online study guide for frontend web development, so that information was easily accessible to refer to when studying on a fast-paced frontend web development bootcamp.

The Prework Study Guide was produced in conjunction with studying an  introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub, and is intended to be added to as subjects are studied in more depth.
